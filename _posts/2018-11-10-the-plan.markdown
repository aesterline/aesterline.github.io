What is my plan for becoming a better functional programmer? Good question. I need to have a mix of
theory and practice. I am collecting books, videos, classes, and articles to help me on my journey.
I am currently working in Scala day to day, so most of my practice will be in Scala. I'll host my
practice exercises on my [GitHub](http://github.com/aesterline) account. If you have suggestions for
other resources, I could use, please let me know.
