I havenâ€™t blogged in a long time, but I think it is time. I need a reason to write regular posts, so
for the near future will be focusing on functional programming. I am interested in two themes in FP.

* How can a good type system influence the way I write software? I want to have the experience of
  "once I got this code to compile it just worked."  
* What is category theory and how will it help me?

I am skeptical about both of these topics. My gut says that the overhead of both isn't worth it in
most cases, but I haven't taken a deep dive to learn them either. I think it is time. I feel like I
am currently missing something and that enlightened moment is just over the hill.

If you have suggestions on how to get started, let me know.
