#### Blog/Write Everyday
I am not very good at writing. The only way I know to get better at writing is to do it more often. I am going to make a habit of writing everyday. As a side benefit, I think [writing everyday](http://www.shubhro.com/2014/12/27/software-engineers-should-write/) will also help my day job.

#### Speak at a conference
I have given presentations at conferences in the past, but I haven't given one in a long time. I enjoy talking in front of a crowd, but I don't think I am very good at it. I need more practice. The only way to get better is to do it.

#### Walk/Run 1500 miles
I spend many hours a day sitting. I need to have fitness goals in order to stay in shape. 1500 miles is a little over 4 miles per day for the year. 1500 miles seems achievable, but not easy.

#### Learn Haskell
I enjoy learning new programming languages. Everytime I learn a new language, I seem to get better writing code in my day job. This year I would like to learn [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org). I am going to start by reading ["Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!"](http://learnyouahaskell.com/).

What are your goals for 2015?
