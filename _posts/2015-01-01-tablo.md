This past fall I purchased a [Tablo](https://www.tablotv.com/). I wanted to finally kick the cable habit. There was one factor that led me to pick a [Tablo](https://tablotv.com) over the alternatives. I wanted to use a single outdoor antenna that I could use on all of my tvs. Given this requirement, I only found two alternatives.

* [Tablo](https://www.tablotv.com/)
* [Tivo Roamio](https://www.tivo.com/discover/antenna)

While it is possible to use multiple tvs with both of these devices, Tablo had one big advantage for me. Tablo isn't designed to be hooked directly into a tv. It doesn't have a remote or HDMI port. Tablo is designed to work with other devices that you already have hooked directly to your tv.  See [How Tablo Works](https://www.tablotv.com/how-tablo-works/) for more information. Why was this an advantage for me? Others might think this is a disadvantage.

The best spot on my house for an outdoor antenna was in a place where we have no tvs. I had two choices. I could run a really long coaxial cable to the nearest tv, or I could find a product that really didn't need to be hooked to a tv. Tablo fit that bill.

After 4 months of use, I have learned a few unexpected things:

* When streaming tv from an iPad to an AppleTV, sometimes it will just stop working. At first I thought this was a problem with the Tablo and I would reboot it. After some experimentation, I found the problem was with the iPad loosing WIFI connectivity. To fix the issue, I just put the iPad into airplane mode for a few seconds and then turn it back off and everything works.
* You can watch tv directly from your computer, by going to my.tablotv.com. This wasn't obvious to me at first.
* Tablo has done a really good job of updating the product. It seems like an update comes about once a month and it always has a new feature I have been wanting.
* If you want to get the most out of your antenna, use [www.antennaweb.org](http://www.antennaweb.org/Address.aspx) to figure out where to point your antenna for the best reception.
* I am surprised how many shows we record to watch later.
* Most of the time the [two tuner](http://amzn.com/B00MXUDD0O) version of the Tablo is fine, but there have been times when I wished I had the four tuner. As I said before, we record more shows than I thought we would. It seems like all the shows we want to watch/record come on at the same time. If I had to do it again, I would purchase the four tuner.
* The picture quality I get through [my antenna](http://amzn.com/B0024R4B5C) is better than the quality I was getting through cable.
* Every Bronco game this year has been available on an [OTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-air_programming) channel.
